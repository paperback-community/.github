# About Us

The Paperback Community develops and maintains extensions for the [Paperback app](https://paperback.moe), an ad-free reader for Apple devices that supports manga, comics, novels, and more.

For detailed guides, extension installation instructions, and more information about our work, visit our [website](https://paperback-community.github.io/).

You can also join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/paperback-community) to connect with the community and get support.

## Our Projects

Within our GitHub organization, you'll find several open-source projects, including:

1. All Paperback extensions contributed by the community.
2. Our website, which simplifies extension installation and includes FAQs and extension development documentation.
3. A template repository that provides a structured starting point for creating and publishing your own Paperback extensions.
4. A Rust-based registry manager that keeps the extension registry up to date by syncing bundled extensions via GitHub Actions.
5. A helper npm package that makes applying extension badges easy.
